            <p class="py-3 leading-8">Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are
                constructible and
                callable. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However,
                the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as
                constructor functions. <br>
                There are two major benefits of using Arrow functions. One is that it's a shorter syntax and thus
                requires less code. The main benefit is that it removes the several pain points associated with the this
                operator. <br>
                But when we write regular function it is too many long ling code we write for simple expression. </p>

            <h3 class="font-medium text-3xl pt-5">What is the Difference between var, let and const keywords in
                JavaScript?</h3>
            <p class="py-3 leading-8">
                <span class="font-semibold text-2xl">Var:</span> The var is the oldest keyword to declare a variable in
                JavaScript. it can be re-decleared , re-assign etc. var is global scope and function scope. <br>
                <span class="font-semibold text-2xl">Let:</span> The let keyword is an improved version of the var
                keyword. The scope of a let variable is only block scoped. It can’t be accessible outside the
                particular block ({block}). <br>
                <span class="font-semibold text-2xl">Conat:</span> The const keyword has all the properties that are the
                same
                as the let keyword, except the user cannot update it. When users declare a const variable, they need
                to initialize it, otherwise, it returns an error. The user cannot update the const variable once it
                is declared.

            <ul class="list-decimal px-5 leading-8">
                <li>they offer a great syntax to define multiline strings</li>
                <li>We can easly move on new line . without any hassle</li>
                <li>It provide us to declear variable in string with $ sing</li>
                <li>They allow you to create DSLs with template tags (DSL means domain specific language, and it’s for
                    example used in React by Styled Components, to define CSS for a component)</li>
                <li>Inside the ${} you can add anything, even expressions</li>
                </ol>

                they offer a great syntax to define multiline strings
                they provide an easy way to interpolate variables and expressions in strings
                they allow you to create DSLs with template tags (DSL means domain specific language, and it’s for
